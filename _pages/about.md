Hi everyone, my name is Yoko Sarah Nakama and am a DevSecOps developer currently based in Gothenburg, Sweden. I mostly like working with Python, Java, and some scripting.

I also have experience working with cloud, both on AWS and Azure.

I first got into coding through my undergraduate research project related to blackhole movement during galactic mergers. I used Python to calculate multiple differential equations to predict the movement of blackholes, and experimenting with Python got me hooked into calculating and predicting models with Python. When I found an opportunity to be a software developer, I decided to take it.

Cybersecurity was something that triggered my curiosity recently while working as a software developer. I learned everything mostly by myself utilising online resources and a few books, and am continuously attempting to play around with what I've learned so far.
